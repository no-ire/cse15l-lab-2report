## Part 2

I was stuck on part 2 and didn't know how to proceed! ;-; \
I was able to create the public key and log on without typing my passoword but I was unable to find the path for both the keys...

## Part 3

Something that I learned and thought was really cool was creating a web server! \
I know that I used git clone for the assignment but I thought it was really interesting to make something that I never was able to do. \
Also learning about paths and directories is pretty interesting. \
A lot of things are actually happening when I'm using the computer but I just never knew about it until now. \
I have ussed ssh before but I think it's interesting because I usually logged on using a password and now I don't have to! :D
